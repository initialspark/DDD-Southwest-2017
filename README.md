JavaScript Services: Building Single Page Applications with ASP.NET Core

Building modern web applications with JavaScript (also known as single-page apps) is becoming an increasingly complex task with a seemingly infinite number of frameworks and build tools. It can be difficult to get an initial project set up and the uniform integration of client and server side code can be challenging. At times, it can seem like a trial and error process. JavaScript Services is a set of technologies that aims to solve these problems for ASP.NET Core developers.

In this session, we’ll build a single page application with Angular to demonstrate the core features of JavaScript Services using ASP.NET Core. Highlights will include:​ Performance and SEO benefits of utilising server-side rendering with your Angular application

Using webpack dev middleware to streamline the build process and enhance the development experience with features such as hot module replacement. The principles presented will be relevant to other JavaScript frameworks and will provide you with insight into potential use cases for running JavaScript on the server.
